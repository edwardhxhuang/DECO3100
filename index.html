        <h2>Which States were most tweeted about?</h2>
        <p>The three states mentioned the most by Trump on Twitter during his presidential term - New York, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Texas (over 220+ mentions) - are unsurprisingly four of the top five most populous states in the US. Interestingly however, California - the US state with the largest population and most electoral votes with 55 - only ranked 7th comparatively. A potential reason for this is due to California generally being considered a 'safe blue state', having voted Democratic in every election since 1992. </p>

        <p>The three states mentioned the most by Trump (New York, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Texas) are unsurprisingly four of the top five most populous states in the US. Interestingly however, California - the US state with the largest population and most electoral votes with 55 - only ranked 7th in comparison. A potential reason for this is due to California generally being considered a strongly Democratic state, having voted Democratic in every election since 1992. Perhaps in some ways, Trump considered it a losing battle not worth fighting and therefore focused less of his attention there.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Papua New Guinea (PNG)</b> - Australia has always provided a high level of aid to PNG since its independence in 1975. Given the country’s size and proximity to Australia, ensuring stability, peace, and resilience in PNG is critical to Australia’s national interests.</li>
            <li><b>Indonesia</b> - Indonesia is a close neighbour and strategic partner with a large population of 270 million. It's growth and success is of fundamental importance to Australia and the region.</li>
            <li><b>Solomon Islands</b> - Australia has a longstanding relationship with Solomon Islands, one of the poorest countries in the Pacific, and is it’s largest development partner. This partnership is based on a shared interest in a prosperous and stable region.</li>
            <li><b>Afghanistan</b> - Decades of war have devastated the people, society, and infrastructure of Afghanistan, leaving it one of the poorest countries in the world. Australia contributes to recovery efforts alongside its allies.</li>
            <li><b>East Timor</b> - Australia is committed to deepening it’s long-term collaboration with close neighbour, East Timor, to address it’s many human development challenges in education, health, and government services.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The socioeconomic and environmental disadvantage experienced by people of these countries cause a number of inequities that can lead to poor health and low life expectancy. The inequality in health outcomes that exists can clearly be seen through the large disparity in levels of child mortality. Whilst significant progress has been made in the last half-century, these countries still have extremely high child mortality rates compared to high-income nations such as Australia.</p>
        <h4>Child Mortality Rates (2017)</h4>
        <p>Number of child (under five years old) deaths per 1000 births</p>
        <div data-aos="fade-up" id="child-mortality-bar">

        <h3>The Global Goal for 2030</h3>
        <p>As a part of the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals established in 2015, every country in the world is committed to reducing the child mortality rate to 2.5% (25 deaths per 1000 births) by 2030. It is a tremendously important goal in reducing global suffering, however currently these nations are still far away from reaching the target.</p>
        <p>Based on historic trends and rates of improvement we are able to make a reasonable prediction into the future. According to this projection, these Australian aid supported countries are all on track to reach this level by 2028. While this is a positive indicator, there is a lot of work that needs to be carried out to successfully achieve this in reality.</p>

        <h2>
            What part does Australian aid play?
        </h2>
        <h3>Investment Priorities and Challenges</h3>
        <p>Australia allocates it’s aid budget into improving specific focus issues based on a country's individual needs. Reducing child mortality in these countries is dependent not only upon investment into a single sector, but rather each division works in conjuction to strategically tackle problems from different vantage points.</p>
        <div data-aos="fade-right" id="investment-vis">
            <script src="investment-vis.js"></script>
        </div>
        <h4>People with access to at least basic drinking water services (% of population)</h4>
        <div data-aos="fade-right" id="water-access">
            <script src="water-access.js"></script>
        </div>
        <p>Inadequate access to safely-managed drinking water and is still alarmingly prevalent amongst these nations. Australia’s investment into health and infrastructure works to improve water and sanitation through initiatives such as delivering water tanks for rural communities, and building resilient water infrastructure to improve wastewater management.
            </p>
        <p>Investments into strengthening governance also support this; an effective public sector better invests a country’s own resources into addressing these challenges and improves service delivery at provincial and district levels.</p>
        <h4>Density of medical doctors (per 10,000 population)</h4>
        <div data-aos="fade-right" id="doctor-density">
            <script src="doctor-density.js"></script>
        </div>
            <p>There is a significant shortage of health workers in these nations causing a weaker health system, and therefore lower access to quality health services that are vital to maintaing a high level of public health.</p>
        <h4>Births attended by skilled health staff (% of total)</h4>
        <div data-aos="fade-right" id="childbirth-vis">
            <script src="childbirth-vis.js"></script>
        </div>
        <p>Key to preventing newborn deaths is ensuring every birth is attended by a skilled health personnel, and that every woman and newborn receives adequate care during the postnatal period. Half of all under-5 deaths still occur in the first month of life. </p>
        <p>Australian aid investment into education aims to bridge this deficit through improving the quality of schooling, training educators, offering scholarships, and providing specialist skills from Australian education institutions to enable young people to gain the skills and qualifications to become skilled workers.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Australia's development assistance plays not only an important role in supporting developing nations to reduce child mortality and improve health outcomes; it's an investment into better lives and futures for millions of people, and a more peaceful and prosperous world.</p>
